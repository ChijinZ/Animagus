Animagus is the prototype of the imitation-based ransomware attack, which aims to help I/O based ransomware detection techniques realize the limits of their feature engineering.

The related paper (Limits of I/O Based Ransomware Detection: An Imitation Based Attack) is accepted by S&P'23.

The related artifacts will be available around the time when the conference is held.
